# Biomarkers and Pain Analysis | Statistics Project

This project is an academic project which demonstrates basic probability and statitics concepts. In this project I've done hypothesis testing and regression modelling. 



The hypothesis tests performed in this project tell us whether there is significant difference in the biomarker levels in males and females at the inclusion. 


Multiple linear regression analysis is performed where the VAS at 12 month is the response variable and explanatory variables such as sex, age and smoking status of the patients along with the biomarker levels at inclusion are considered.
